css-spinner
===========

A CSS3-only Animated Spinner.  Includes Sass/Compass partial to generate spinners with different options.

You can download the basic spinner CSS from the css directory (css-spinner.css).

Or you can check out the source and build the CSS files using Compass.  From the main directory, run:

    compass compile
    
This will regenerate the CSS files from the SCSS files.

The scss folder contains the partial _spinner.scss which contains the mixin to generate spinner classes.  
Right now the only option is to create a different size.  Check out the [test page for a demo](http://daneden.me/animate/).
